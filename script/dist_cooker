=head1 NAME

dist_cooker - create a Perl distribution skeleton from personal templates

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	# from the command line, to create a distribution for Module::Name
	% dist_cooker Module::Name

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<dist_cooker> builds a Perl distribution skeleton from template
files. You create the templates however you like.

By default, I assume my own favorite values, and haven't made these
customizable yet.

=over 4

=item C<ttree> (from Template) is in C</usr/local/bin/ttree>

=item Your distribution template directory is F<~/.templates/dist_cooker>

=item Your module template name is F<lib/Foo.pm>

=back

When C<cook> processes the templates, it provides definitions for
these template variables:

=over 4

=item module      => the package name (Foo::Bar)

=item module_file => module file name (Bar.pm)

=item module_dist => the distribution name (Foo-Bar)

=back

=head2 Writing a subclass

To provide a different set of defaults, or more customizable behavior,
create your own subclass of C<Distribution::Cooker>. Specialize the
parts that you need.

=head1 TO DO

C<Distribution::Cooker> needs to provide a way for people to override
the defaults without having to write a subclass.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Other modules, such as C<Module:Starter>, do a similar job but don't
give you as much flexibility with your templates.
